## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.1 established the foundational project structure, User model, and authentication. This story builds upon that foundation by adding core trading functionality.

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**Trade Model:**
```typescript
interface Trade {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  symbol: string;
  direction: 'LONG' | 'SHORT';
  entryPrice: number;
  positionSize: number;
  stopLoss: number;
  exitPrice: number | null;
  status: 'ACTIVE' | 'CLOSED';
  entryDate: Date;
  exitDate: Date | null;
  realizedPnL: number | null;
  riskAmount: number;
  notes: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Prisma Schema Addition:**
```prisma
model Trade {
  id           String      @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  symbol       String
  direction    TradeDirection
  entryPrice   Float
  positionSize Float
  stopLoss     Float
  exitPrice    Float?
  status       TradeStatus
  entryDate    DateTime
  exitDate     DateTime?
  realizedPnL  Float?
  riskAmount   Float
  notes        String?
  createdAt    DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime    @updatedAt
  
  user           User              @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  methodAnalysis MethodAnalysis[]
  mindsetTags    MindsetTag[]
}

enum TradeDirection {
  LONG
  SHORT
}

enum TradeStatus {
  ACTIVE
  CLOSED
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture.md#api-specification]

**POST /api/trades**
- Creates new trade with risk validation
- Request body: CreateTradeRequest interface
- Validates 2% individual and 6% portfolio risk limits
- Returns 201 with created trade or 400 with risk error

**GET /api/trades**
- Returns user's trades with filtering
- Query params: status (ACTIVE, CLOSED, ALL)
- Includes related methodAnalysis and mindsetTags

### Risk Calculation Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#critical-implementation-requirements]

**CRITICAL: Risk Calculation Formula**
```typescript
import Decimal from 'decimal.js';

const calculateTradeRisk = (entryPrice: number, stopLoss: number, size: number): number => {
  return new Decimal(entryPrice)
    .minus(stopLoss)
    .abs()
    .times(size)
    .toNumber();
};

const calculatePortfolioRisk = (trades: Trade[]): number => {
  return trades
    .filter(trade => trade.status === 'ACTIVE')
    .reduce((total, trade) => new Decimal(total).plus(trade.riskAmount).toNumber(), 0);
};
```

**Risk Validation Rules:**
- Individual trade risk must not exceed 2% of total equity
- Total portfolio risk must not exceed 6% of total equity
- Use database transactions to prevent race conditions

### Frontend Component Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

**TradeForm Component:**
```typescript
interface TradeFormProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
}

// Key features:
// - Real-time risk calculation using shared utils
// - React Hook Form for validation
// - Risk warning banner when limits exceeded
// - Integration with React Query for API calls
```

**TradeList Component:**
- Display trades in table/list format
- Show key info: symbol, direction, entry price, risk, status
- Responsive design for mobile viewing
- Loading states and error handling

### File Locations
- Trade types: `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`
- Trade API routes: `apps/api/src/routes/trades.ts`
- Risk calculations: `packages/shared/src/utils/calculations.ts` (shared between frontend/backend)
- TradeForm component: `apps/web/src/components/TradeForm.tsx`
- TradeList component: `apps/web/src/components/TradeList.tsx`
- API client: `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture.md#security-and-performance]
- All API endpoints require Supabase JWT authentication
- Input validation with Zod schemas prevents injection
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Request deduplication prevents double-submission

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Risk calculation precision with Decimal.js
- 2% and 6% risk limit validation
- Concurrent trade creation race conditions
- Form validation edge cases
- API error handling and recovery

**Test Structure:**
```
apps/api/tests/integration/routes/trades.test.ts
apps/web/tests/unit/components/TradeForm.test.tsx
apps/web/tests/unit/components/TradeList.test.tsx
tests/e2e/trading.spec.ts
```

#### Testing Standards
- Mock Supabase auth in unit tests
- Test database transactions and rollbacks
- Verify Decimal.js precision in financial calculations
- Test form validation with invalid inputs
- E2E tests cover complete trade creation flow
