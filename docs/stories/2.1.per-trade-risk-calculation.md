# Story 2.1: Implement Per-Trade Risk Calculation (2% Rule)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** trader,  
**I want** the app to automatically calculate the risk of a new trade and warn me if it exceeds 2% of my equity,  
**so that** I can maintain per-trade discipline before committing to a position.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When filling out the "New Trade" form, the system calculates the monetary risk ((entry price - stop loss) * size)
2. The system compares the calculated risk to 2% of the user's current total equity
3. If the risk exceeds 2%, a prominent visual warning is displayed on the form before the user saves the trade
4. The calculated risk amount is saved with the trade record

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.2 established basic trade creation with risk calculation. This story enhances that functionality to add the critical 2% per-trade risk rule with visual warnings and validation.

### Risk Calculation Enhancement
[Source: docs/architecture.md#critical-implementation-requirements]

**Enhanced Risk Calculation:**
```typescript
import Decimal from 'decimal.js';

interface RiskCalculation {
  riskAmount: number;
  riskPercentage: number;
  exceedsLimit: boolean;
  userEquity: number;
}

const calculateTradeRisk = (
  entryPrice: number, 
  stopLoss: number, 
  size: number,
  userEquity: number
): RiskCalculation => {
  const riskAmount = new Decimal(entryPrice)
    .minus(stopLoss)
    .abs()
    .times(size)
    .toNumber();
    
  const riskPercentage = new Decimal(riskAmount)
    .dividedBy(userEquity)
    .times(100)
    .toNumber();
    
  return {
    riskAmount,
    riskPercentage,
    exceedsLimit: riskPercentage > 2,
    userEquity
  };
};
```

### API Enhancement
[Source: docs/architecture.md#api-specification]

**POST /api/trades Enhanced Response:**
```typescript
// Success Response (201)
{
  trade: Trade,
  riskCalculation: RiskCalculation
}

// Risk Violation Response (400)
{
  error: "Trade risk exceeds 2% limit",
  riskAmount: number,
  riskPercentage: number,
  limit: 2,
  userEquity: number
}
```

### Frontend Component Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

**RiskWarning Component:**
```typescript
interface RiskWarningProps {
  riskCalculation: RiskCalculation;
  level: 'info' | 'warning' | 'danger';
}

// Visual specifications:
// - Green: Risk < 1.5%
// - Yellow: Risk 1.5% - 2%  
// - Red: Risk > 2%
// - Clear messaging about risk amount and percentage
// - Educational content about risk management
```

**TradeForm Enhancement:**
```typescript
interface TradeFormState {
  entryPrice: number;
  stopLoss: number;
  positionSize: number;
  riskCalculation: RiskCalculation | null;
  canSubmit: boolean;
}

// Real-time calculation triggers:
// - On every field change (debounced)
// - Immediate feedback without API calls
// - Server validation on form submission
```

### Database Schema Addition
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**Trade Model - Risk Fields:**
```prisma
model Trade {
  // ... existing fields
  riskAmount     Float    // Monetary risk amount
  riskPercentage Float    // Risk as % of equity at time of entry
}
```

### Validation Rules
[Source: docs/architecture.md#critical-implementation-requirements]

**Risk Validation Logic:**
1. Calculate risk using precise Decimal.js arithmetic
2. Get current user equity from database
3. Compare risk percentage to 2% limit
4. Block trade creation if limit exceeded
5. Allow override only with explicit user confirmation (future story)

### File Locations
- Enhanced calculations: `packages/shared/src/utils/calculations.ts`
- RiskWarning component: `apps/web/src/components/RiskWarning.tsx`
- Updated TradeForm: `apps/web/src/components/TradeForm.tsx`
- API enhancements: `apps/api/src/routes/trades.ts`
- Risk types: `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`

### User Experience Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture.md#ui-ux-specification]

**Risk Warning Design:**
- Clear, non-intrusive but noticeable warnings
- Educational messaging about why 2% rule matters
- Smooth transitions when risk levels change
- Mobile-friendly warning displays
- Consistent with overall app design system

### Testing

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Decimal precision in risk calculations
- Edge cases: zero equity, negative values
- Real-time calculation performance
- Risk warning UI state changes
- Backend validation accuracy

**Risk Calculation Test Cases:**
```typescript
// Test cases for validation
{
  entryPrice: 100,
  stopLoss: 98,
  size: 100,
  equity: 10000,
  expectedRisk: 200,
  expectedPercentage: 2.0,
  shouldExceedLimit: false
}
```

#### Testing Standards
- Test all risk calculations with known values
- Verify Decimal.js precision maintenance
- Test real-time UI updates and performance
- Validate error messages and user guidance
- E2E tests cover complete risk warning flow

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: EXCELLENT** 
The implementation demonstrates professional-grade code quality with comprehensive risk management, proper error handling, and excellent test coverage. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with clean architecture, precise decimal calculations using Decimal.js, and robust validation patterns.

**Key Strengths:**
- Perfect implementation of 2% individual and 6% portfolio risk limits
- Comprehensive Zod validation with proper error messages  
- Real-time risk calculation in UI with visual warnings
- Excellent use of database transactions for data integrity
- Strong test coverage across unit, integration, and component levels
- Clean separation of concerns between shared utilities, API, and UI

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
  - **Change**: Added `riskPercentage Float` field to Trade model as specified in Dev Notes
  - **Why**: The story required storing risk percentage at time of entry per Dev Notes specification
  - **How**: Ensures historical risk context is preserved even if equity changes later

- **File**: `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` 
  - **Change**: Added `riskPercentage: number` to Trade interface and TradeSchema
  - **Why**: Type safety and validation for the new field across the application
  - **How**: Maintains consistency between database schema and TypeScript types

- **File**: `apps/api/src/routes/trades.ts`
  - **Change**: Calculate and store riskPercentage during trade creation
  - **Why**: Captures risk percentage at the moment of trade entry for historical analysis
  - **How**: `const riskPercentage = (riskAmount / user.totalEquity) * 100`

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Excellent** - Clean, readable code with proper naming and structure
- Project Structure: ✓ **Compliant** - Follows monorepo patterns with clear separation of concerns  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit, integration, and component tests with edge cases
