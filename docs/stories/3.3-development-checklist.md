# Story 3.3: Development Preparation Checklist

## Pre-Development Setup ✓

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- [x] Story 3.2 (Mindset Tagging) marked as Complete
- [x] Story 3.1 (Method Analysis) implementation available
- [ ] Review existing MethodAnalysis types and structure
- [ ] Verify current TradeForm component architecture
- [ ] Check existing shared utilities and calculation functions

### Architecture Review
- [ ] Review alignment rules engine design (lines 67-204 in story doc)
- [ ] Understand signal-direction alignment scoring algorithm
- [ ] Review API endpoint specifications (POST /api/trades/analyze-alignment)
- [ ] Study frontend component specifications (AlignmentIndicator, AlignmentFeedback)

## Development Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Signal Alignment Rules Engine (Backend Foundation)
**Files to create/modify:**
- `packages/shared/src/types/alignment.ts` - Alignment interfaces and types
- `packages/shared/src/utils/alignment.ts` - Core alignment calculation logic
- `packages/shared/src/utils/calculations.ts` - Enhancement for alignment functions

**Key Components:**
- [ ] AlignmentRule interface with indicator mapping
- [ ] AlignmentAnalysis interface with scoring system
- [ ] analyzeAlignment function with weighted scoring
- [ ] Divergence bonus/penalty logic
- [ ] Timeframe-specific alignment considerations

### Task 2: Backend API Implementation
**Files to create/modify:**
- `apps/api/src/routes/alignment.ts` - New alignment analysis endpoints
- `apps/api/src/routes/trades.ts` - Enhanced trade creation with alignment
- Add alignment validation and storage

**API Endpoints:**
- [ ] POST /api/trades/analyze-alignment - Real-time alignment analysis
- [ ] Enhanced POST /api/trades - Include alignment in trade creation
- [ ] GET /api/trades/{id}/alignment - Retrieve alignment analysis

### Task 3: Frontend Components
**Files to create:**
- `apps/web/src/components/AlignmentIndicator.tsx` - Visual alignment display
- `apps/web/src/components/AlignmentFeedback.tsx` - Real-time feedback component

**Files to modify:**
- `apps/web/src/components/TradeForm.tsx` - Integrate alignment analysis
- `apps/web/src/components/TradeList.tsx` - Show alignment status
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` - Add alignment API functions

### Task 4: Integration and Real-time Feedback
**Features to implement:**
- [ ] Real-time alignment analysis during trade form entry
- [ ] Warning dialogs for conflicted trades
- [ ] Confirmation badges for well-aligned trades
- [ ] Alignment-based sorting and filtering in trade list

### Task 5: Testing Strategy
**Test files to create:**
- `apps/api/tests/unit/alignment-calculations.test.ts` - Alignment logic tests
- `apps/api/tests/integration/routes/alignment.test.ts` - API endpoint tests
- `apps/web/tests/unit/components/AlignmentIndicator.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `apps/web/tests/e2e/alignment-workflow.spec.ts` - E2E alignment workflow

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement alignment rule caching
- [ ] Add debouncing for real-time analysis
- [ ] Optimize scoring algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Minimize API calls during form interaction

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Form Input** → Method Analysis Selection
2. **Real-time Analysis** → POST /api/trades/analyze-alignment  
3. **Alignment Calculation** → Rules Engine Processing
4. **UI Feedback** → AlignmentIndicator + AlignmentFeedback
5. **Trade Submission** → Enhanced POST /api/trades with alignment

### Integration Points
- [ ] Verify MethodAnalysis interface compatibility
- [ ] Check TradeForm state management for alignment integration
- [ ] Ensure alignment data persists with trade records
- [ ] Validate alignment display in TradeList component

## Quality Assurance Preparation

### Test Scenarios to Validate
- [ ] Strong bullish alignment (MACD Buy + RSI Oversold + Bullish Divergence)
- [ ] Strong bearish conflict (MACD Sell + bearish divergence vs LONG trade)
- [ ] Mixed signals with weighted scoring
- [ ] Edge cases: no method analysis, incomplete data
- [ ] Performance with multiple timeframes

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] Real-time feedback responsiveness
- [ ] Warning message clarity and helpfulness
- [ ] Educational content integration
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness of alignment components

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Start with Task 1**: Create alignment types and rules engine in shared package
2. **Build incrementally**: Test alignment calculations before moving to API layer
3. **Frontend integration**: Add components and integrate with existing TradeForm
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Ensure all alignment scenarios work correctly
5. **Performance validation**: Verify real-time feedback performance

**Estimated Development Time:** 8-12 hours across 6 tasks
**Priority:** High (completes Three M's framework implementation)
