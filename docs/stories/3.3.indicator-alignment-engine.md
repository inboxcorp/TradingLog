# Story 3.3: Implement Indicator Alignment Engine

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** trader,  
**I want** the app to analyze my chosen signals and warn me if they conflict with my trade direction, while promoting trades that show strong alignment,  
**so that** I can improve my trade selection discipline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system contains a basic rules engine that understands if a signal (e.g., "Bullish Divergence") aligns with a trade direction (Long or Short)
2. When saving a trade, the system evaluates the signals from all three timeframes
3. If a signal conflicts with the trade direction, a warning is displayed on the trade record
4. If all signals align perfectly with the trade direction, a positive confirmation or promotion (e.g., a green checkmark) is displayed on the trade record

### Previous Story Context
Story 3.2 established mindset tagging functionality. This story implements the rules engine that validates technical analysis alignment, completing the "Method" component of the Three M's framework.

### Signal Alignment Rules Engine
[Source: docs/architecture.md#critical-implementation-requirements]

**Alignment Rules Logic:**
```typescript
interface AlignmentRule {
  indicator: IndicatorType;
  signal: SignalType;
  bullishAlignment: number; // -1 to 1 scale
  bearishAlignment: number; // -1 to 1 scale
  weight: number; // Importance weight
}

const ALIGNMENT_RULES: AlignmentRule[] = [
  // MACD Rules
  {
    indicator: 'MACD',
    signal: 'BUY_SIGNAL',
    bullishAlignment: 1.0,
    bearishAlignment: -1.0,
    weight: 0.8
  },
  {
    indicator: 'MACD',
    signal: 'SELL_SIGNAL',
    bullishAlignment: -1.0,
    bearishAlignment: 1.0,
    weight: 0.8
  },
  
  // RSI Rules
  {
    indicator: 'RSI',
    signal: 'OVERSOLD',
    bullishAlignment: 0.7,
    bearishAlignment: -0.3,
    weight: 0.6
  },
  {
    indicator: 'RSI',
    signal: 'OVERBOUGHT',
    bullishAlignment: -0.3,
    bearishAlignment: 0.7,
    weight: 0.6
  },
  
  // Divergence Rules
  {
    indicator: 'ANY',
    signal: 'ANY',
    bullishAlignment: 1.0, // When divergence is BULLISH
    bearishAlignment: -1.0,
    weight: 1.0
  }
];

interface AlignmentAnalysis {
  overallScore: number; // -1 to 1 scale
  alignmentLevel: 'STRONG_CONFLICT' | 'WEAK_CONFLICT' | 'NEUTRAL' | 'WEAK_ALIGNMENT' | 'STRONG_ALIGNMENT';
  warnings: string[];
  confirmations: string[];
  timeframeBreakdown: Array<{
    timeframe: TimeframeType;
    score: number;
    analysis: MethodAnalysis;
    alignment: string;
  }>;
}

const analyzeAlignment = (
  tradeDirection: 'LONG' | 'SHORT',
  methodAnalysis: MethodAnalysis[]
): AlignmentAnalysis => {
  let totalScore = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;
  const warnings: string[] = [];
  const confirmations: string[] = [];
  const timeframeBreakdown = [];
  
  for (const analysis of methodAnalysis) {
    const rule = ALIGNMENT_RULES.find(r => 
      (r.indicator === analysis.indicator || r.indicator === 'ANY') &&
      (r.signal === analysis.signal || r.signal === 'ANY')
    );
    
    if (!rule) continue;
    
    // Calculate alignment score for this analysis
    const alignmentScore = tradeDirection === 'LONG' ? 
      rule.bullishAlignment : rule.bearishAlignment;
    
    // Apply divergence bonus/penalty
    let divergenceMultiplier = 1;
    if (analysis.divergence === 'BULLISH' && tradeDirection === 'LONG') {
      divergenceMultiplier = 1.2;
    } else if (analysis.divergence === 'BEARISH' && tradeDirection === 'SHORT') {
      divergenceMultiplier = 1.2;
    } else if (analysis.divergence !== 'NONE') {
      divergenceMultiplier = 0.8; // Penalty for misaligned divergence
    }
    
    const finalScore = alignmentScore * divergenceMultiplier;
    const weightedScore = finalScore * rule.weight;
    
    totalScore += weightedScore;
    totalWeight += rule.weight;
    
    // Generate warnings and confirmations
    if (finalScore < -0.5) {
      warnings.push(`${analysis.timeframe}: ${analysis.indicator} ${analysis.signal} conflicts with ${tradeDirection} direction`);
    } else if (finalScore > 0.5) {
      confirmations.push(`${analysis.timeframe}: ${analysis.indicator} ${analysis.signal} supports ${tradeDirection} direction`);
    }
    
    timeframeBreakdown.push({
      timeframe: analysis.timeframe,
      score: finalScore,
      analysis,
      alignment: finalScore > 0.5 ? 'ALIGNED' : finalScore < -0.5 ? 'CONFLICTED' : 'NEUTRAL'
    });
  }
  
  const overallScore = totalWeight > 0 ? totalScore / totalWeight : 0;
  
  const alignmentLevel = overallScore > 0.7 ? 'STRONG_ALIGNMENT' :
                        overallScore > 0.3 ? 'WEAK_ALIGNMENT' :
                        overallScore > -0.3 ? 'NEUTRAL' :
                        overallScore > -0.7 ? 'WEAK_CONFLICT' : 'STRONG_CONFLICT';
  
  return {
    overallScore,
    alignmentLevel,
